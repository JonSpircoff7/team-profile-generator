## Introduction

This is an application created for UCF bootcamp students to learn how to use Nodejs and some of the functionality within. Users will be able to create a team page with user inputs via a prompt. This has been quite the challenge as learning to turn plain english into computer language has been quite the task for myself and I hope that in the future this logic will become more understandable for me.

## Installation

    -nodejs
    -VsCode
    -Gitbash for a simple terminal

## Usage

Please check for requirements to run this application. 
Use the terminal to run this application, type in "Node index.js" and answer the prompts. After you build your team, click on the finish building option.
