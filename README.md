## Introduction

This is an application created for UCF bootcamp students to learn how to use Nodejs and some of the functionality within. Users will be able to create a team page with user inputs via a prompt. This has been quite the challenge as learning to turn plain english into computer language has been quite the task for myself and I hope that in the future this logic will become more understandable for me.
